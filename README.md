I started this game with no plan, and pulled off something many would call awesome.

This game will be a football game featuring 4 players on each team, with the offensive team have 3 blockers and a runner.

The offensive player will get a random number that allows the user to move that many squares.

Each turn will get a mninimum of f4 moves so the offense can move each player atleast 1 block in any direction.

The offense will get 1 point for each of the 10 yards gained plus 6 points for each touchdown.

There are no firstdowns

the game is 4 quarters which each player has a chance to score 2 times each quarter.
